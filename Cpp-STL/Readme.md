## Introduction

The C++ Standard Template Library (STL) is a powerful set of C++ template classes to provide general-purpose classes and functions with templates that implement many popular and commonly used algorithms and data structures like vectors, lists, stacks, queues, and more. The STL makes it easier to write efficient, reusable, and maintainable code.

This directory is intended to be a learning resource for those who want to understand and use the C++ STL in their projects. We provide code examples, explanations, and best practices to help you leverage the STL effectively.

## Getting Started

Before diving into the examples, ensure that you have a basic understanding of C++ programming. If you're new to C++, it's recommended to familiarize yourself with the language syntax and concepts first.

To run the examples in this repository, you'll need a C++ compiler installed on your system. You can use popular compilers like GCC or Clang. Make sure to compile and execute the examples according to the instructions provided in each example's README.

## Examples

This repository contains examples organized into different categories, including but not limited to:

- Containers: Examples demonstrating various container classes such as pairs, vectors, lists, maps, and sets.
- Algorithms: Illustrations of different algorithms provided by the STL, including sorting, searching, and more.
- Iterators: How to use iterators to traverse and manipulate container elements.
- Smart Pointers: Examples showcasing smart pointers like `std::shared_ptr` and `std::unique_ptr`.
- and more!

Feel free to explore the examples and use them as a reference for your own projects. Each example includes clear explanations and comments to help you understand the code.
