## Introduction

This repository is designed to help you learn and practice data structures, algorithms, and the C++ STL. Whether you're a beginner looking to get started or an experienced developer looking for reference materials, you'll find a wealth of information and examples here.

## Data Structures

In the `data_structures` directory, you'll find implementations of various fundamental data structures, including but not limited to:

- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, etc.)
- Graphs
- Hash Tables
- And more!

Each data structure comes with detailed explanations and code examples to help you understand their principles and usage.

## Algorithms

The `algorithms` directory contains a wide range of algorithm implementations, covering topics like:

- Sorting (Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Bubble Sort, etc.)
- Searching (Binary Search, Linear Search, etc.)
- Dynamic Programming
- Graph Algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's, etc.)
- Greedy Algorithms
- Divide and Conquer
- And many others!

Each algorithm is accompanied by explanations, time complexity analysis, and practical examples.

## C++ STL Examples

The `cpp_stl` directory provides practical demonstrations of using the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) to solve real-world problems. You'll find examples of using STL containers (vector, map, set, etc.), algorithms (sorting, searching, etc.), and other useful features.
